Background
Welcome to the Spring 2024 version of the   comprehensive   assignment   prepared   specifically   for   Accounting   362.
Made   up   of   2   parts this assignment   is   meant to fulfill a   number of   objectives   for you. These   include:
1) Test and apply your   knowledge of the   concepts   of   advanced   management   accounting.
2)   Increase your experience and abilities with   respect   to   report   writing.
3)   Illustrate scenarios and   issues you will face   in the “real world”
4)   Provide for   an   additional   method of evaluation of your   knowledge and   skills rather   than the traditional tests.
Please take all   parts of this assignment   seriously. This   is   an   opportunity to   actually   apply   your   knowledge   rather than just   memorize a textbook.
Please   prepare the assignment   using either Word or   Excel   rather than   by   hand.   The   finished product will   look   more   professional as well as create   some   consistency   between   submissions.All submissions   must   be on   8   1/2   by   11-inch   paper   using a size   12 font   (Times   New   Roman   or      Arial), single space, double space,   or   anything   in   between.      Use your judgment.   Grammar   and   spelling are very   important,   and   marks will   be deducted for   poor grammar   and   spelling.

MUSTAFA DAY CARE CENTER   (MDCC)
The Mustafa Day Care Center, Inc. (MDCC) began operations   in   a vacant warehouse retrofitted
with bathrooms and kitchen facilities. MDCC’s mission is to provide quality, affordable
childcare to the residents of   the community and surrounding area.   The   service   area   is   a   rural,
economically depressed town that continually ranks in the lowest   10 percent   of   per-capita
income   in   the   country. The   organization’s   seven-member   board   of   directors   is   comprised   of
volunteer representatives from various agencies throughout the community–the school district,   community college, hospital,   Services BC, etc. The board members bring a breadth of   human
services experience to the oversight of   the day care, but most   do not   possess   an   accounting   or
financial background. While they were committed to the financial viability of   the day care,   they initially focused on the center’s mission–to provide affordable childcare to working-class
families. As a result, the board set childcare rates to achieve their goal   of   affordability   rather   than   assuring adequate revenues to provide high-quality services while reaching breakeven points.
From   its   founding,the   center   faced   another   significant   challenge.   The   center   was   the   first   of   its kind in the community, so negative perceptions about using “institutionally” provided day   care   were prevalent. Local families preferred to use in-home childcare provided by friends or relatives. These perceptions and preferences, coupled with poor administrative practices, caused   the center to struggle continually to meet its financial   obligations. MDCC   was   almost   forced   to         close its doors on more than one occasion. The   financial performance of   MDCC   is   not unusual,      as many community-based day care facilities struggle to remain   open.
DAY CARE INDUSTRY REVENUE AND COST PATTERNS
As an industry, day care facilities generally   operate with very   low profit margins.   Typical   for-
profit day care profit margins are approximately 4 percent, with about 70 percent   of   a   center’s
total costs attributed to wages and other employee-related costs.   In   British   Columbia   there   is   a
legislation to protect and promote the health, safety, and well-being of   vulnerable children, youth
and adults receiving care in licensed care facilities.      This   legislation   is the   Community   Care   and   Assisted Living Act, Child Care Licensing Regulation and Residential Care   Regulation.      The
licensing regulations drive a significant level of   employee-related costs.   These regulations
mandate a strict staff-to-child ratio that all licensed   facilities must   follow.   For   example,   infant      care (ages two weeks to two years) regulations require at least one   staff   member for   every   four   children (see excerpt from regulations in Exhibit   1). Thus, if   a   center pays   just   the minimum
wage (currently $12.65 per hour, $15 per hour with taxes and benefits), at   least   $3.75 per hour   would   need   to   be   charged   for   each   infant   just   to   cover   the   cost   of   the   employee. Additionally,      one must consider how revenues are affected when there are fewer than   four infants per employee scheduled in the nursery. When the ratio drops, income per hour   drops; however, the      full hourly wage to the employee remains the same and an   immediate   loss   occurs.   See Exhibit   1   for   the   complete   staff   ratio   requirements.In addition to labour, other costs that impact day   care   center   operations   include   occupancy   costs,   food, insurance, supplies, and programming expenses. Occupancy and   food   costs   are   also highly   influenced by the Community Care and Assisted Living Act, as a   facility   must provide   a   minimum amount of   space per child (based on age)   and   follow   specific nutritional   guidelines  代 写Accounting 362 Individual Comprehensive Case Part 1 Spring 2024Python

MDCC PLANNING AND OPERATIONS
About five years into operations, a new board of   directors was   appointed, and   strategic   objectives   were developed. As its first strategic actions, the board replaced the   Center’s   administration   and         developed specific operating procedures to keep the facility afloat financially.   To   eliminate   the community’s negative perceptions of   institutionalized childcare, the board decided to move the center to a higher-quality facility. After further study, the board concluded that   constructing   a new facility would be the best option for providing quality childcare in   an   attractive   and   safe   environment. In addition, the new building would house the First Nation’s Aboriginal Head Start   program and the local school district’s handicapped pre-school program, as these programs were   housed in inadequate facilities. Thus, the MDCC board spearheaded the   construction   of   an   8,000-square-foot building that would be owned by MDCC, Inc., and funded in part by   a         government loan to support B.C.’s rural development.
During the planning and construction of   the new facility but prior to its opening,   the   MDCC board had to resolve a few issues. First and foremost, the board   did not   want   to   raise   the
childcare rates, for fear that doing so would deter   people   from patronizing the   facility.   On   the
other hand, the board was not at all positive that the existing rates would   cover the costs
associated with the new building. In addition, MDCC was becoming a landlord, and this   created         additional concerns for the board. MDCC agreed to lease floor   space   or   rooms   to   the   First Nation   and school district, perform. facility maintenance, and provide utilities. MDCC did not provide
any   furniture   or   fixtures. The   board’smain   question: How   much   rent   should   MDCC   charge   the
tenants? The MDCC board researched the lease rates charged to the area’s commercial   retail
facilities and determined that $20 per   100 square feet   was   the   going   rate   and   decided   to   charge
their tenants at this rate. Because the board members were not experienced in making financial
and capital expenditure decisions, they did   not fully consider   that   this   rate   was   for   floor   space
only; commercial leaseholders typically pay all of   their own utilities, sanitation,   and   maintenance   fees. Thus, the board had inadvertently created the potential for a   future   financial   crisis   for
MDCC.   Selected post-construction revenues, costs, and operational information for MDCC   follow.
MDCC COST STRUCTURE
LABOUR COSTS
MDCC maintains a staff   of   employees assigned to each age-level   classroom   that   is   in   compliance   with regulations. The staff   schedule is rotated throughout the week so that the   staff-to-child ratio
is always maintained while no one employee works more than 40 hours per   week. The   employer’s   labour   costs   include   payroll   taxes   and   benefits   arepresented   in   Exhibit   2.
FOOD COSTS
The center provides food for MDCC patrons, but it does not charge   a   separate   fee   to   recover   the   cost of   snacks or meals. The cost of   food is included   as part   of   the   tuition   fee.   In   addition,   the employees are required to remain on-site during the lunch hour in order to   maintain   the   staff-to-   child ratio, so their meals are also provided by the center. All   children   and   classroom   staff receive breakfast, lunch, and two snacks   a   day.
OCCUPANCY COSTS
Building:   Because MDCC worked in conjunction with the local school   district   and the
Aboriginal Head Start program prior to constructing the new facility, the building was purposely   built larger than the space required by the day care only.   Consequently, when   it   came   time   to
analyze costs, it was the board’s opinion that the Aboriginal Head   Start   and   school   district   programs should share in the   costs   of   the building.
Utilities:   When MDCC designed the facility, it considered the needs of   the tenants   and   designed   their   rooms   accordingly. The   board   did   not   have   the   foresight, however, to   setup   the   tenants’ rooms with their own gas, electric, and water meters. Therefore,   all of   the   utilities   are measured   through common meters, and MDCC pays the bills for the entire   facility. The   only   exception   to   this is the telephone expense,   as each program contracts   and pays   for its   own phone   service.   See   Exhibit 4 for   details.
Maintenance, etc.:   As specified in the lease agreement, MDCC pays the   entire building’s expenses related to maintenance, cleaning supplies, and sanitation.   See Exhibit   4   for   details.
INSURANCE COSTS
MDCC has four different insurance costs: property, general liability,   officer’s bond,   and
worker’s compensation. The property insurance covers the entire building. The   general   liability   insurance covers the children and staff   in the MDCC program and   helps   protect   the   center
against accidents or claims against the staff.   The tenants must   carry   their   own   liability   insurance.   The bond insurance on the officers covers the center for   any   inappropriate handling   of   financial         matters by the board of   directors. Finally, the worker’s compensation insurance covers the administration and MDCC employees for work-related   injuries.
OTHER OPERATING COSTS
A complete listing of   the organization’s operating expenses   is   shown   in Exhibit   2.   The   costs   not   previously discussed include administrative or program costs such   as   accounting,   advertising, continuing education, and supplies. These costs are   attributable   solely   to   MDCC.
THE ACCOUNTANT’S CHALLENGE
Rather than addressing the revenue and cost issues that arose   during the   facility   construction, the   board took a “wait and see” position and opted to   review both   the   childcare   rates   and rental   rates   after   the   new   facility   had   begun   operations. After   the   first   year   of   building   occupancy, the   MDCC board wanted to evaluate the costs and revenues associated with   each of   the   day   care’s   and tenants’ programs. The board hired CH to explain why the center is running   at   a   loss. You   indicate that you believe that both the childcare rates and rental rates were set without   establishing correlation to the costs that they were intended   to cover. You   also   state that you   want to take the time to complete a thorough cost and profitability   analysis of   the   day   care’s   childcare programs and tenant agreements. In order to do   so, you   decide to   implement   an   activity-based costing system to allocate costs to the various programs and   tenants.
Exhibits 2 and 3 provide revenue and expense information   for the   first year   of   operations   at the
new facility. Exhibits 5-7 provide additional information useful for the   cost   analysis   and   decision   making.
ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING—A QUICK REVIEW
Activity-based costing (ABC) is used frequently in manufacturing   settings because it   typically   improves product cost information. ABC replaces arbitrary cost allocations by   first   assigning         costs to activities and then to goods based on how much   each good uses   the   activities.   The   concepts of   ABC can also be applied to service-based organizations where   tangible products   do not exist. In a service organization, costs   are   assigned to   the various   activities performed,   cost   drivers that measure the activities performed are identified, cost driver rates   are calculated   for each activity, and the resulting rates are used to assign activity   costs to   the   types   of   services   provided. This process reflects the causal relationship between the activity, the costs created by   the activity, and the assignment of   these costs   to   services.
IDENTIFICATION OF COST DRIVERS
There are many activities present in a day care   setting   that   create   or   drive   costs.   An   example   is
the preparing and serving of   food. It is relatively   easy to   assign many   of   the   costs,   such   as   food
and direct labour, to this activity. It is more difficult, however,   to   assign   costs   to   many   of   the
most significant activities that occur   regularly in a   day   care.   These   activities   (like reading   a book,   playing a game, or teaching a skill) are key   components   of   the   service being provided—
childcare— but they are difficult to measure. Therefore, identifying each of   the   individual
activities that drive cost and then assigning cost to the   daycare programs based   on those   activities
maybe   cost   prohibitive. For   that   reason, MDCC   places   activities   into   broad   category
classifications. When considering drivers that would be cost effective yet causally related   to   the         costs being incurred, population or a population subset becomes the driver identified for many   of the   activity   cost   pools. Population   maybe   measured   in   terms   of   enrollment, class   size,   or   number of   staff.   See Exhibit 7.
